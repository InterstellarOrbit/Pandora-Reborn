About Johnabcs1/InterstellarOrbit: Truly, the best gift to someone who loves space is to give them a movie that truly inspires them. On my 9th Birthday, I recieved a copy of Avatar when it just came out for DVD. It still remains my favorite movie, ahead of The Martian and Interstellar.

I started playing Rimworld when Alpha 14 came out. I started messing around with creating mods when a16 came out. And now, the idea of this mod came to me when looking for a new background for my Desktop. 

The point of this document is to not say that I just thought of making this mod just to do it, it is to say that I am a true fan of the Avatar franchise. Immense Research, Editing and Coding was and will 
continue to be put into this mod.

MOD INACCURACIES

This is where all the mod inaccuracies will be listed. If you find one, please either message InterstellarOrbit on Ludeon forums, or Join the discord for the mod.

1. Backstory(English Student)
	Although there was only a few confirmed students, the mod adds this to relate to the movie more. 

2. Names   Names may be incorrect. They may not be structered correctly. This is due to technical downfalls. Also, Some letters are not able to be displayed due to Rimworld. They have been replaced by standard English Letters. (I,i;A,a) replaced (Ì,ì;Ä,ä).
